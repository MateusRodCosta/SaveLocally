<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>:
Starting with v1.2.3, a 1 kb buffer is used for the file copy, but that accidentally introduced a bug: zeroes would be added at the end of the saved file so its size becomes a multiple of 1 kb.
If the files you are saving don't absolutely need to match 1-to-1 the original, you should be fine, otherwise the added zeroes could cause issues (for example, diverging checksums).

Version 1.3.1 fixes that bug. Sorry for any inconveniences!
