• Upgraded dependencies
• Fixed an issue where the app would crash if trying to save bigger files
  • This was caused because previously the entire file was loaded to memory and bigger files hit a memory usage system limit
• The file saving logic is now handled asynchronously thanks to Kotlin coroutines
