<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>:
Starting in v1.2.3, a 1 kb buffer is used for the file copy, but that introduced a bug: zeroes might be added at the end of the saved file.
This was fixed in 1.3.1, please report any issue you may find!

Version 1.3.2 is a maintenance release which updates dependencies and brings minor under-the-hood changes.
