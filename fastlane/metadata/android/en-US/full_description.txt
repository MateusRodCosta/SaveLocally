Sometimes some apps decide to not provide a Save option, this is usually due to not wanting to implement the logic for saving a file themselves, however they usually provide a Share functionality to take advantage of the system share system.

In these cases Save Locally might come in handy, allowing you to save the file to any place in your device by registering as one of the possible share options for files and showing a file picker for saving.

Save Locally is developed with Jetpack Compose and licensed under AGPLv3+. Source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/MateusRodCosta/Share2Storage">https://github.com/MateusRodCosta/Share2Storage</a>.
