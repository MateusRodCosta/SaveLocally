Some apps decide to not provide a Save option, this is usually due to the devs not wanting to implement the logic for saving a file themselves, however they usually provide a Share functionality to take advantage of the built-in system share system.

In those cases Save Locally might come in handy, allowing you to save the file to any place in your device by registering as a share option on the share sheet, showing the file details and then allowing opening a file picker for saving.

Save Locally is FLOSS software (Free and Libre Open Source Software) developed with Jetpack Compose. Source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/MateusRodCosta/Share2Storage">https://github.com/MateusRodCosta/Share2Storage</a> licensed under AGPLv3+.
